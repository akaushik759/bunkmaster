This is a web tool which helps students calculate the number of classes they can bunk for each subject. 
Just input the Subject Name, Total Number of Classes of the subject and voila !

You get the number of times you can bunk that class further to make it to 65%, 75% or 85%

The best part?
It doesn't have a backend, yet it stores all your subjects such that you don't have to input it everytime.
